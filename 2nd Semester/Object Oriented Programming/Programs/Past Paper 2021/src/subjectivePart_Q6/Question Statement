A publishing company that markets both book and audio-cassette versions of
its works. Create a class called publication that stores the title
(type string) and price (type float) of a publication also has an abstract
method "Oversize()". From this class desire two classes: book, which adds a
no of page (type int) and tape: which adds a playing time in minutes (type float).
Each of the three classes should have a getdata() methods to get its data from
the user from the keyboard, and a Setdata() method to display the data. Override
the "Oversize()" method to the book and tape classes. Let's say that a book with
more than 500 pages, or a tape with a playing time longer than 90 minutes, is
considered oversize. You can access this method from main() and display the string
"Oversize" for oversized books and tapes when you display their data. Demonstrate
polymorphic behavior by using these classes.
