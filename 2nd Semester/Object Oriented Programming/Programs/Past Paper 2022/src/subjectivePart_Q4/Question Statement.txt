Create a constructor for the student class you created. The constructor should initialize
each Student's ID number to 9999, his or her points earned to 12, and credit hours to 3
(resulting in a grade point average of 4.0). Write a program that demonstrates that the
constructor works by instantiating an object and displaying the initial values.
